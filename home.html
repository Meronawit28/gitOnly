                    Welcome to My Portfolio!

                    Hello! I'm Meron Gizaw, a passionate and driven software engineering student currently pursuing my degree at HiLCoE. With a strong foundation in software engineering principles and a keen interest in developing innovative software solutions, I am excited to showcase my skills and projects through this portfolio.

                    Throughout my academic journey, I have gained hands-on experience in various programming languages such as Java and c++ as well as web development technologies like HTML and CSS. I thrive on tackling complex challenges and enjoy collaborating with others to create impactful applications that enhance user experiences.

                    In this portfolio, you will find a selection of my projects, ranging from web applications to software tools, along with detailed descriptions of my contributions and the technologies used. Each project reflects my commitment to continuous learning and my enthusiasm for applying theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios.

                    I invite you to explore my work and get in touch if you’d like to discuss potential collaborations, internships, or just share insights about the tech industry. Thank you for visiting!
